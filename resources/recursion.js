// EXAMPLE PROBLEM
  // Write a recursive function that given an input n sums all nonnegative integers up to n

// FIVE STEPS TO SOLVE ANY RECURSIVE PROBLEM

  //1. What is the simplest possible input
    // ex: n = 0
    // Usually the base case

  //2. Play around with examples and visualize (Draw it out)
    // ex:
    // n = 1 (1)
    // n = 2 (1 + 2)
    // n = 3 (1 + 2 + 3)
    // n = 4 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)

  //3. Relate hard cases to simpler cases
    // Ask yourself...If I was given the answer to the n = 4 case, could I solve the n = 3 case.
    // If I was given the answer to the n = 3 case, could I solve the n = 2 case.

  //4. Generalize the pattern

  //5. Recursive leap of faith
